# LoginBox
Login Box using Java (Packages Used: 1)Swing 2)Java AWT )
      In the proposed LOGIN BOX WITH CAPTCHA, security system will generate the captcha by using a new improved
    algorithm which will be interesting to solve at the same time it
    will be tougher than previous to solved by the bots while will
    feel easy. The humans have limitations on the speed of
    response then compared to any computer and hence the
    computer must be slower than the human and so we will make full benefit of this and use it in the proposed system.
Packages Used: 1) javax.swing
               2) java.awt.event
               3) java.util.Random
1) Swing package.
    It is a part of Java foundation class that is used to create window
    based application, which is built on top of AWT i e abstract windowing
    toolkit API and entirely written in java.
2) AWT Event Package.
    Provides interfaces and classes for dealing with different types of
    events fired by AWT components. See the java.awt.AWTEvent class for
    details on the AWT event model. Events are fired by event sources. An event
    listener registers with an event source to receive notifications about the
    events of a particular type. This package defines events and event listeners,
    as well as event listener adapters, which are convenience classes to make
    easier the process of writing event listeners.
3) Util Random Package.
    Random class is used to generate pseudo-random numbers in java. An
    instance of this class is thread-safe. The instance of this class is however
    cryptographically insecure. This class provides various method calls to
    generate different random data types such as float, double, int.
